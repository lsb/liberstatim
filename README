This is LiberStatim, an editor/reformatter of Latin texts in the style of Clyde Pharr's Aeneid: text at the top of the page, and a large section of footnoted vocabulary at the bottom.
The web interface works under Firefox and IE.
It can produce a single 8.5"x11" pdf, for printing simplex on common personal printers, and a 6"x9" pdf and its corresponding wrap-around cover, for printing at http://lulu.com .

Using a slightly modified version of David Kastrup's bigfoot package,
and a database of all words in the Latin Library's corpus that the Perseus 3 morphological analysis can analyze,
the Ruby 1.6 script creates LaTeX output for the words and their footnotes.
Because of the limitations of pdfeTeX 3.14159-0.14h, we can't change the job name, so we read in into a stub file that's copied for each job.

For additional footnotes, enclose the text in @ signs.  See 09d17db0bbe3dbbf, and 09d17db0bbe3dbbf.pdf, for an example.

version of this code.)
